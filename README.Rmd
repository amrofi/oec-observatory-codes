# OEC Observatory Codes

## Description

Scripts to recreate the trade data available at the [Observatory of Economic Complexity](http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/). 

We have a repo explaining the methodological details. Please visit [OEC Documentation](https://observatory-economic-complexity.github.io/oec-documentation/) and the [Official website](http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/) for the details. 

These scripts are released under MIT license.

## How to use this project

While you can run the scripts from UNIX terminal, we highly recommend [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).

Each project is organized as an RStudio project. Each project contains a master script titled `0-some-function.R` at the top level but some projects such as _Product Space_ are organized in subfolders where each subfolder contains a master script.

The master script, for any case, runs a function with user prompt and/or simple scripts. The safe way to run this without errors is to open the project and then run the master script from RStudio.

[OEC Packages Snapshot](https://github.com/observatory-economic-complexity/oec-packages-snapshot) stores all packages and its dependencies used across all repositories under this organization. To ease reproducibility [OEC Bundles](https://github.com/observatory-economic-complexity/oec-bundles) contains several bundles to avoid dependencies or packages related problems, and this project already contains an unbundled set of packages.

You can read more about RStudio projects [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects).

## Project structure

```
oec-observatory-codes
└── README.md
└── README.Rmd
└── 0-do-all.R
└── 0-scripts
└── 1-country-data
└── 2-product-data
└── packrat
```

## Output

The script generates different files organized under `1-country-data/` and `2-product-data`.

### Generated files

#### Country names (tsv)

```{r country1, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
skimr::skim(fread("1-country-data/country-names.tsv")) %>% skimr::kable()
```

#### Country names (rdata)

```{r country2, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
load("1-country-data/country-names.RData")
skimr::skim(country_names) %>% skimr::kable()
```

#### Product names (HS rev 1992, tsv)

```{r product1, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
skimr::skim(fread("2-product-data/hs-rev1992-product-names.tsv")) %>% skimr::kable()
```

#### Product names (HS rev 1992, rdata)

```{r product2, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
load("2-product-data/hs-rev1992-product-names.RData")
skimr::skim(hs92_product_names) %>% skimr::kable()
```
